##Algorithm Tutorial

  We'll look at algorithms to perform 2 of most common processes when dealing with
  data: *searching* and *sorting*.




#Sorting
  Sorting often needs to be done before searching. Imagine you are creating1 a
  phonebook (see Wikipedia t0 learn what that is ;): You have 10,000 people to put
  in the book and you want to organize these names. By organising the names
  (in this case alphabetically), finding a specific name later will be much easier.

##Selection Sort
  1)Find the smallest card. Swap it with the first card.
  2)Find the second-smallest card. Swap it with the second card.
  3)Find the third-smallest card. Swap it with the third card.
  4)Repeat finding the next-smallest card, and swapping it into the correct
    position until the array is sorted.
